                The White Cliffs of Dover are one of Englandâ€™s most recognizable landmarks.
                The sheer cliffs of white chalk mark the closest part of England to the continental landmass,
                with Dover serving as an important port town throughout history. The port is busy to this day,
                and ferry passengers traveling to and from France enjoy perhaps the most striking views of the symbolic sight.

                Dover Museum is beautifully set out and expresses the early days of Dover.
                The Museum is finds from the stone age, bronze age, the Romans occupation and through to the Anglo Saxons and more recent eras.
                Each area is well defined and exhibits are well presented and explained.
                The highlight of the museum is the bronze age boat on the top floor. It is an incredible find, well presented and documented.
                It makes you realize that these early bits were a clever and sophisticated people with incredible skills, as is shown in the design and construction of the boat.
